      <p>The underutilized potential of an urban node that could be turned into an attraction viable site where pedestrian circulation is enhanced and the potential of the urban node could be realized into a social function in adjacency to the rainwater canal and the rocky cliff topography.</p>
      <p>The project was initiated to make use of that urban node by forming a public library and youth center to attract citizens for a social interactive environment. as well as responding to the water canal by providing a ramp that crosses over it providing a separate path for pedestrians rather than having their path with the carsâ€™ road.</p>

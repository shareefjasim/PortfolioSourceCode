## Feedback & Design Notes

- **Project card sizes**: Two distinct sizes cover all use-cases
- **Glassmorphism**: Replace "black squares" and icons with semi-transparent, frosted-glass panels
- **Dynamic accent colors**: Cycle between soft palettes that look great in both light & dark modes
- **Scrollbar**: Tweak thickness & thumb-track styling for mobile UX

---

## TODO

- üåÄ Page transitions (fade/slide between routes)
- üé¥ Card redesign: eliminate scroll-jank & swinging motion
- üì± Scrollbar adjustments: improve touch targets on phones
- üñºÔ∏è Glassmorphism on icons & panels
- üé® Dynamic color theming for both modes
